     * Processes a transaction receipt from a windows store purchase.

     * Once verified, the players account will be credited with the Virtual Good, or Virtual Currency the purchase contains. The virtual good will be looked up by matching the productId in the xml with the 'WP8 Product ID’ configured against the virtual good.

     * Key | Value | Description
     * :- | :- | :-
     * verificationError | 1 | No matching virtual good can be found

     * verificationError | 5 | The Id in the receipt xml has previously been processed
